        <h1>Swimming</h1>
        <p>
            I have been a competitive swimmer for almost 12 years. I started swimming with Swim Neptune
            when I was 7 years old and continued until colege, where I am continuing to do so with 
            Brandeis University.<br>

          <h2>Going the Extra Mile</h2>

          <p>
            In summer of 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic I joined a challenge with two
            other teammates and my coach to swim 25 miles in 24 hours, swimming 1 mile on the hour, every
            hour. We did this as a fundraising event to help the assisted living homes in our community. Over
            the duration of this challenge, we raised $36000 to buy personal protection equipment (PPE) for 
            various assisted living locations, and after, we personally delivered all of the PPE.

        <h2>Water Safety for Refugees</h2>

        <p>
            I taught water saftey best practices to refugee children. Many of these kids didn't know
            how to speak english, so I spent a lot of time trying to overcome this language barrier.
            Eventually, the kid I was working this learned how to do a basic freestyle and could confidently
            support himself in the water.
